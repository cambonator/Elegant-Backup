os.listdir()  # lists files and folders in directory (NOT recursive) 
os.getcwd()   # gets current working 
os.mkdir(path)    # makes directory in path (NOT recursive)
os.makedirs(path)  # makes directory in path recursively 
os.remove(path)   # used to delete files
os.removedirs(path)  # used to delete directories
os.system(command)   # runs command in terminal


Stuff to do:

DONE: cross platform capability (find a python function replacement function for xcopy)
DONE?: Have it make all dest directories if they don't exist 
(that way xcopy doesn't ask that prompt and hold up the backup process 
especially if the user is away from the computer)
DONE: Add log file capabilities
DONE: Make it delete directories (in destination)
DONE: Add more verbose output


- Record number of errors and output this at the end
- Enable the script to skip specified files and folders
- Have it log the python error output (currently this is not recorded 
due to the try, except statements i think...)

- Have it check that the files and folders are actually the same?

Long term stuff to do:
- GUI?
- Include support for archiving
- Include support for encryption?
- Add support for crazy filename ASCII characters
- Convert to Python 3+ capatibility
